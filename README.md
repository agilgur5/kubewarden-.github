#README
This repository is a special GitHub repository used to apply default community health files to all Kubewarden repositories.

More information is available on GitHub documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)

Please keep in mind that existing community health files on Kubewarden repositories override files from [kubewarden/.github](https://github.com/kubewarden/.github).
